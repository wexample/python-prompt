# wexample-prompt

CLI prompt utilities for Python applications with rich terminal output support.

## Development rules

- Use Pydantic as much as you can
- Use typing as much as you can
- Each class stands in a separated file using the same name in snake case

### Testing

- The tests directory follow the same structure as the main package directory. Each tested class has a corresponding test class prefixed with test_.
